# Motherboard
## CPU
Only CPUs that match the socket will fit
Pick processor first. If you get an overclocked CPU, you'll need an overclockable motherboard

## RAM
\# of RAM Slots does not always equal # of channels.

## PCI Express Slots
Used for connecting peripherals, Bluetooth, Wireless, etc, but notably graphics cards
PCIe 2.0 16x has same bandwidth as PCIe 3.0 8x.
2.0 vs 3.0 isn't anything to worry about.


# Graphics Card
### Cooler
The "case" of the card.
### PCB
The actual card that does things
### Reference or Custom.
Reference is made by Nvidia/AMD.
Custom are made by vendors.
Both coolers and PCBs can be either reference or custom
Actual cards are made by the vendors, AMD/Nvidia create the "blueprints".
Custom generally better, for a bit of a price.
### VRAM
Importance scales with graphics needs. Resolution, MSAA, etc.
# CPU
## Thermal Paste
Cooler heatsinks don't fit flatly on top of CPU, so there's space between the two
Thermal paste fills the gaps
# RAM
## Channels

Channels are how data is transferred from the RAM to the memory
controller. If you have a dual channel motherboard and use compatible RAM
sticks and place them in the correct slots, you can double the memory
throughput. # of sticks increases capacity, # of channels increases throughput.
