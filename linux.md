## Boot

The boot process depends on the kind of firmware installed on the motherboard, generally BIOS or UEFI. UEFI is the newer of the two.

### UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)
UEFI launches EFI applications, usually stored in the EFI partition.

#### GPT
GUID Parition Table (GPT) is a paritioning scheme designed to replace the traditional Master Boot Record (MBR). It is a table of entries defining partitions in the disk and the info associated with them (partition type, name, attributes)
#### Advantages over MBR
- MBR table entries are limited to a max size of 2 TiB, due to block addresses being 32 bits. GPT addresses are 64 bits, allowing a max disk size of 9.4 ZB.

#### EFI Partition
The EFI partition is often the first partition on the disk
The EFI applications are stored in `/EFI/vendor_name`.

#### Boot Process
- Power On Self Test (POST)
Checks that memory, cpu, etc is operating correctly

- Hardware is initialized (keyboard, mouse, etc)
