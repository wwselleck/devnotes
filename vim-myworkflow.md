# My Vim Workflow
This is how I do things in Vim.

## Finding Files
`,ff` Opens the fuzzy file finder, which is how I navigate around to different files the majority of the time

For finding files that I know are close to the file I'm currently working on, `,j` will open netrw inside of the active dir.

## Searching Across Project
`,e` Will open Grepper, which uses `rg` to do a grep-style search in the active directory
<todo: Figure how to put word under curosr into Grepper automatically>

## Find and Replace Across Project
<todo>
